\textbf{Dear Members of the Search Committee,}\\[1.5em]
%I am writing in response to your advertisement for the Faculty Member in Information Technology position at United Arab Emirates University (UAEU).  I am currently a Ph.D. candidate  at Cognitive Robotics Research Centre, University of Wales, Newport, UK. I am expecting to complete my degree in October 2010. I respectfully submit this letter of application, for I believe my experiences and commitment to research and teaching make me well qualified to meet the needs of UAEU’s dynamic program.

As a PhD student at Newport, I have achieved my diverse academic background and skill in the area of networking, robotics and intelligent multi-agent systems. Since 2007, I have been shepherding UK's one of the largest multi-robot teams which consists of more than 40 e-puck robots and state-of the-art network cluster and other hardware. Here I have specialized in multi-robot systems by developing bio-inspired control algorithms and software frameworks for multi-robot control, communication and  position tracking. %By developing a full-fledged multi-robot control system I have gained significant knowledge and experience in distributed computing and computer vision.
%and customizing the state of the art SwisTrack multi-robot tracker,

During my Masters study at Korea Institute of Science \& Technology (KIST), I studied the information security and several robotics courses at Korea University and conducted practical research on mobile robots at KIST's highly equipped research laboratories. I developed an intelligent security scheme and a real-time humanoid control system for the Korean humanoid robot named \textit{Mahru}.
%, such as the Center for Cognitive Robotics and the Intelligent Media Research Center

Since 1999, I am an open-source developer. I have been awarded the  prestigious \textit{ Google's summer-of-code open-source development sponsorship} twice (in 2010 competition, acceptance rate is 18\% out of 5,539 total applicants). In 2009, I worked for \textit{Bluez} and successfully tested the feasibility of integrating short-range \textit{NFC} communication with \textit{Linux Bluetooth stack}. In 2010 competition, I was mentored by a cryptographic expert and successfully developed a decentralized introduction scheme for \textit{Tahoe-LAFS}.

At Newport, I mentored 8 visiting postgraduate students (4 French, 3 Spanish and 1 Indian) in completing their final-year research projects. I also taught undergraduate and masters students on Linux and networking courses at Bangladesh University of Engineering \& Technology and also at Int'l Islamic University of Chittagong, Dhaka campus, Bangladesh.

%I had also contributed code to several open-source projects such as SwisTrack and E-puck robot. 

During the years of my study in abroad, I have developed a strong ties with  distinguished researchers working in the world-leading institutions e.g. the University of the Wast of England, Imperial College London (UK),  Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, (Switzerland) and Korea Advance Institute of Science and Technology (South Korea). 

Now I am highly interested to research towards building a world-class multi-robot team for deploying in emergency search and rescue missions.  Besides, I am also keen to contribute in teaching courses of various levels and areas. Please find the details of my research track records, publications and teaching interests in my CV. I look forward to discussing with you about my specific research proposal.\\[1em]
Thank you very much for your consideration.\\[1.5em]
Sincerely,\\[1em] % if the opening is "Dear Mr(s) Doe,"
%Yours faithfully,\\[2em] % if the opening is "Dear Sir or Madam,"
